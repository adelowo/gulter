# Gulter

Gulter is a Go HTTP middleware designed to simplify the process of uploading files for your web apps. It follows the standard
`http.Handler` and `http.HandlerFunc` interfaces so you can always use with any of framework or the standard library router.

> Name and idea was gotten from the insanely popular multer package in Node.JS that does the same.
